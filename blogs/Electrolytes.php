        <h1>The TRUTH About Electrolytes</h1>

        <p>We like to assert our humanity by saying to people that we're not robots. But our bodies share a fundamental necessity with our programmed comrades.</p>

        <p>Human bodies, in their organic complexity, operate on ELECTRIC impulses, just like your coffee maker, only we use our minds and not buttons.</p>

        <h3>Charging Humans</h3>

        <p>There is no pure water in the body whatsoever. That would be dangerous because pure water does not conduct electricity.</p>

        <p>Electricity in the body charges nervous impulses, muscles, and even regulates PH levels. Electricity runs <em>everything</em>.</p>

        <p>The name of the minerals that conduct electricity?</p>

        <h3>Electrolytes</h3>

        <p>Electrolytes carry electric charge in all liquid in your body. Their balance is VITAL to keeping everything functioning with POWER.</p>

        <p>Brains send electricity through liquid electrolyte solutions in and around nerve cells, which send signals to cells throughout the whole body.</p>

        <p>Low on electrolytes? <em>Thinking</em> and <em>moving</em> will become more challenging, as bodily processes that rely on electricity (pretty much all of them) slow down.</p>

        <p>Lack of electrolytes comes with <em>dizziness</em>, <em>weakness</em>, <em>cramps</em>, and ongoing problems with muscles, brain, and energy.</p>

        <p>Here's a quick breakdown of dietarily essential electrolytes for humans and why they're important:</p>

        <h4>Sodium (Na+)</h4>

        <p>Sodium is a conductor of the electrical signals that keep your body in rhythm. From fluid balance to nerve transmission and muscle contractions, sodium is at the heart of many vital processes.</p>

        <h4>Potassium (K+)</h4>

        <p>Potassium is crucial for heart health, muscle function, and nerve signaling. It works closely with sodium to maintain cellular integrity and fluid balance.</p>

        <h4>Calcium (Ca2+)</h4>

        <p>Beyond bone health, calcium is essential for muscle function, nerve signaling, and blood clotting.</p>

        <h4>Magnesium (Mg2+)</h4>

        <p>Magnesium is involved in hundreds of reactions in the body. It supports muscle and nerve function, energy optimisation, and the synthesis of proteins.</p>

        <h4>Chloride (Cl-)</h4>

        <p>Paired often with sodium, chloride helps keep fluid balances in check and plays a role in digestion, as a component of stomach acid.</p>

        <p>If you lose a lot of water, through exercise and hot weather, these vital minerals matter more. And this is especially true if you're following a keto diet.</p>

        <h3>How To Cure Keto Flu</h3>

        <p>On a keto diet, you lose electrolytes <em>faster</em>, ESPECIALLY when starting out.</p>

        <p>Carbs breakdown to glucose, which is stored in the body as glycogen. Glycogen stores water. Water stores ELECTROLYTES.</p>

        <p>Flushing out excess sugar and optimising fat burning is aamazing, but take care as you may flush out more electrolytes.</p>

        <p>Ironically, mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, require electrolytes to drive metabolism.</p>

        <p>And because a keto diet is likely to INCREASE your metabolism, you need to replace MORE than the electrolytes you LOSE to feel the full benefits of ketosis.</p>

        <p>Here's one simple, clean, healthy, keto friendly way to get what you need:</p>

        <h4>Sodium &amp; Chloride</h4>

        <p>Although most people consume enough sodium and chloride in food, consider adding more if you are on a keto diet, very active, in a hot place, or losing more water than normal.</p>

        <p>Be careful. RDA for sodium and chloride in adults is generally considered to be around 1,500 to 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day.</p>

        <p>Himalayan salt is considered a healthy choice. Supplements from a trusted provider are a good way to go.</p>

        <h4>Potassium</h4>

        <p>Potassium is must come from food, and does wonders for quick recovery. RDA in adults is around 2,600mg to 3,400mg per day.</p>

        <p><span>You can achieve that in a keto friendly way with:</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span>1 avocado (1,000mg)</span></li>
            <li><span>2 cups of yoghurt (600mg per cup)</span></li>
            <li><span>2 bananas (400mg each)</span></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Calcium</h4>
        <p>Calcium is crucial for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth. RDA for calcium in adults is around 1,000mg per day.</p>

        <p><span>You can achieve that in a keto friendly way with:</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span>2 cups of yoghurt (300mg per cup)</span></li>
            <li><span>2 cups of leafy greens (200mg per cup).</span></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Magnesium</h4>

        <p>Magnesium is involved in hundreds of enzymatic reactions in the body. RDA for magnesium is 400mg in men and 300mg in women.</p>
        <p> <span>You can achieve that in a keto friendly way with:</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span>2 cups of leafy greens (150mg per cup)</span></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><span>Men could add:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>1 avocado (60mg)</li>
            <li>1 cup of yoghurt (40mg per cup)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>We hope that's a good starting point. Feel free to get creative, and <a class="electroLink" href="https://soloketo.com/pages/contact" title="Contact">Contact Us</a> with any questions or comments whatsoever.</p>
