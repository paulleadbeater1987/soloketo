        <h1>Why Does Burning Fat Feel Good?</h1>

        <p>Conventional talk about losing weight regularly fails to focus on the main goal; fat burning. Unless you'd
            rather lose muscle, this is beyond debate.</p>

        <p>As part of the fat burrning process, the liver uses fat to build ketone bodies to use as energy.</p>

        <p>Ketosis is a bodily state where you burn more fat than glucose for energy. Many, when they switch to keto
            nutrition, are pleasently surprised to learn this FEELS better.</p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Less hunger</li>
            <li>Craving more healthy foods</li>
            <li>More focus</li>
            <li>Energy levels THROUGH THE ROOF</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>How is it that switching your energy source from carbs to fat can have all these amazing benefits?</p>

        <p>Evidence suggests that ketone bodies are a preferred source of energy, especially for the brain. In ketosis,
            the brain is powered by around 75% ketone bodies and 25% glucose.</p>

        <p>Even in deep ketosis, glucose as is still used fuel. HOWEVER, the body can create all the glucose it needs
            from fat and protein.</p>

        <p>So why, when it has access to BOTH, does your brain make this switch? Why use so much more ketone bodies?
            Well, clearly we've evolved this way for a reason, and in this case, the reason may lie in our
            mitochondria...</p>

        <p>I remember from high school science class that mitochondria are the powerhouses of our cells.</p>

        <p>Mitochondria must combine with glucose or ketone bodies to create energy. Evidence suggests, ketone bodies
            are MORE EFFECTIVE because for every unit of oxygen they combine with in the mitochondria, they've been
            shown to produce MORE ENERGY than glucose. So on keto, every time you breath in, YOU CREATE MORE POWER.</p>

        <p>But that's not all..</p>

        <p>Studies also show that when you consistently power your brain with ketone bodies, gene expression in your
            brain changes for the better, allowing you to create MORE mitochondria.</p>

        <p>So not only can ketosis MAKE EACH POWERHOUSE MORE POWERFUL, it can also CREATE MORE POWERHOUSES. Pretty
            impressive stuff.</p>

        <p>But that's not all..</p>

        <p>Ketosis may INHIBIT a major source of neuronal stress; reactive oxygen species. A byproduct of cellular
            metabolism, these highly reactive molecules roam through the body, bombarding into proteins and cell
            membranes, wrecking their structure.</p>

        <p>Ketone bodies have been shown to directly inhibit the production of these violent molecules AND enhance their
            breakdown. The result of less of these molecules reacting with your brain is that you'll be able to THINK
            CLEARER.</p>

        <p>And last of all..</p>

        <p>Brain neurons, which drive basically everything, exist on a balance between excitement and inhibition. Our
            two main neurotransmitters are the excitatory glutamate and the inhibitory GABA.</p>

        <p>Glutamate overload causes more chaos in the brain, which can lead to anxiety and stress. GABA is the
            opposite, allowing you to relax and process information.</p>

        <p>Ketone bodies have been shown to directly inhibit our neurons from overloading on glutamate and improve GABA
            receptors. As a result, your brain is a lot more able to THINK CALMER.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>None of this is exact science and it would be wise to consider your doctor before changing your diet if you
            haven't already. But we've experienced all of this; more energy, clearer thoughts and calmer thoughts. And
