        <h1>What Happens When We Fast?</h1>

        <p>Fasting is rarely advised by western doctors, but studies have shown it to have a PLETHORA of health benefits
            that go WAY BEYOND just weight loss, which of course, it's VERY effective for. A lot of these benefits can
            be experienced on a keto diet, as a keto diet mimics fasting in many ways, so if you haven't already, I urge
            you to check out our blog, "Why does ketosis feel so good?" Here, we're going to look at what happens
            specifically, when we're doing intermittent or prolonged fasting.</p>

        <p>The purpose of intermittent fasting is to cut down the hours of the day in which we're consuming food. So
            this usually means 1-2 meals a day and no calorie intake outside of this. A common method is to have an 8
            hour eating window and 16 hour fasting window (16:8) although some take it as far as a 4 hour eating window
            and 20 hour fasting window (20:4), which can increase the benefits, should you have the discipline to do it.
        </p>

        <p>One benefits of intermittent fasting is that it gives the gut, a much needed rest, as with most people, it
            NEVER gets a rest. As someone with IBS, I can personally attest to this as it has helped a lot with my own
            symptoms. Needless to say, we probably haven't evolved to eat exactly 3 meals per day, at specific times of
            the day and there's a lot of other benefits to giving your gut a break like this.</p>

        <p>It's been shown to increase your white blood cells, which can strengthen your immune system. It can increase
            stem cells, which can revive your immune system. It can reduce inflammation. You can also get an increase in
            human growth hormone, which builds and maintains muscle. Regular exercise has been shown to increase human
            growth hormone by around 700% whereas regular intermittent fasting can increase it by as much as 2,000%
            making it a pretty cool biohack. It can increase testosterone in men by around 180%. It can reduce hunger
            cravings and SPEED UP metabolism. And it help regrow your brain cells. So that means better MEMORY, MOOD and
            FOCUS.</p>

        <p>Prolonged fasting is typically when you go without any caloric intake for a day or more. This should be done
            sparingly, but undertaken once in a while, say every month or two, can be one of the absolute best things
            you can do for your health as it gives you all the above benefits of intermittent fasting and more. Please
            note that the times below may vary from person, but here's a good breakdown:</p>

        <p>Around 12 hours fasting can put you into a state of ketosis, the benefits of which are discussed extensively
            in our other blog - "Why does ketosis feel so good?"</p>

        <p>Around 18 hours can put you into a deeper state of ketosis where you're now generating significant ketone
            bodies, which have now pretty much fully replaced glucose as your primary energy source.</p>

        <p>At around 24 hours, your body can start recycling old cells and breaking down misfolded proteins. This
            process is called autophagy and is amazing for system regeneration.</p>

        <p>By around 60 hours , insulin can drop to its lowest level, and your body is becoming more sensitive to it,
            the opposite to diabetes and pre-diabetes, which is a state of very high insulin resistance.</p>

        <p>By around 72 hours, your body can start breaking down the old and generating replacements in all kinds of new
            places, including in many immune cells. This is where the magic of the bodily reset really begins to kick
            in.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>None of this is exact science and it would be wise to consider your doctor before trying intermittent and
            prolonged fasting if you haven't already. But we've experienced all of this and it's done wonders for our
            health. If you'd like to SUPERCHARGE your way there, then check out our #1 Biohacking tool, the drinkable
