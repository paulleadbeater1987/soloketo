    <h1>Unpacking The MYTHS Behind Cholesterol</h1>

    <h3>Horror Hormone</h3>
    
    <p>Cholesterol is a word that strikes fear into many hearts. Associated with clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and further heart problems, it has become a major health concern.</p>
    
    <p>Statin drugs are commonly prescribed to lower cholesterol. Before you proceed with that, consider the fact that cholesterol is a hormone with many vital functions.</p>
    
    <p>Cholesterol discussions usually focus on LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein). LDL is labelled "bad cholesterol" and HDL "good cholesterol". Technically, LDL and HDL aren't even cholesterols. More on that later.</p>
    
    <p>Approximately 15%-20% of our cholesterol comes from our diet. Most is made by the liver and the rest by the cells. Interestingly, the more cholesterol we consume, the less the body makes, suggesting its levels are carefully controlled.</p>
    
    <h3>What Is Cholesterol?</h3>
    
    <p>Cholesterol is a fat-like raw material, appearing in cell membranes around EVERY CELL. It makes up part of the brain and skin lining and is even necessary for vitamin D construction.</p>

    <p>Primarily, cholesterol is used for building hormones…ALL hormones. Everything from steroid hormones like testosterone and oestrogen, to adrenal hormones like adrenaline and cortisol.</p>

    <p>Hormones are chemical messengers that carry information throughout the body. All major body functions, like reproduction, metabolism, blood pressure, energy levels, appetite, sleep, blood sugar balance, and ageing, are impacted by hormones.</p>

    <p>Therefore, cholesterol tests are in some part affected by HOW YOU FEEL.</p>
        
    <p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4370130/">study</a> on 208 undergraduate students tested their cholesterol levels before and after examination and they found:</p>

    <blockquote>"there was statistically significant increase in serum cortisol, adrenaline, Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels in students under examination stress compared to the non examination period."</blockquote>
    
    <p>Cholesterol is also a component of bile, a fluid that comes from your liver to help digest fats in the small intestine. It breaks down fats into fatty acids so that they can be absorbed and used for energy on a keto diet.</p>
    
    <h3>So Why Does Cholesterol Scare People?</h3>
    
    <p>With so many functions, we obviously need cholesterol, but an excess can be dangerous in some circumstances. To understand this properly, let's unpack some myths.</p>
    
    <p>Firstly, there's no such thing as good and bad cholesterol. LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) are cholesterol <em>transporters</em>.</p>
    
    <p>Cholesterol itself is fat based, and like all fats, it doesn't mix well in water. It cannot be transported through the blood without these protein based transporters.</p>
    
    <p>LDL transports cholesterol from liver to blood, where it's transported to cells.</p>
    
    <p>HDL transports excess cholesterol the opposite way; back from cells to liver where it can be processed.</p>
    
    <p>LDL can be labelled as "bad cholesterol" because blockages occur when cholesterol remains in the bloodstream, unable to find a cell.</p>
    
    <p>HDL can be labelled "good cholesterol" because blockages can be cleared when cholesterol is transported back to the liver.</p>

    <p>It’s true that HDL helps prevent ATHEROSCLEROSIS (arteries become narrowed and hardened due to buildups of fats and plaques on artery walls).</p>
    
    <p>However when it comes to LDL, there are TWO TYPES and only one is ATHEROGENIC, (can promote formations of fats and plaques that block arteries).</p>
    
    <p>lbLDL (large buoyant low-density lipoprotein) is NOT ATHEROGENIC because it is larger and less likely to penetrate artery walls, get trapped, become oxidized, inflamed, and develop fats and plaques that block arteries.</p>

    <p>The ATHEROGENIC VILLAIN is called sdLDL (small dense low-density lipoprotein). Its smaller size allows it to more easily penetrate artery walls, where it can get trapped, become oxidized, inflamed, and develop fats and plaques that block arteries.</p>
    
    <h3>What Causes sdLDL Excess?</h3>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Slow metabolism</li>
    <li>Insulin resistance</li>
    <li>Obesity</li>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>Oxidation</li>
    <li>Inflammation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A piece could be written about each of these.</p>

    <h3>So What Can You Do To <strong>FIGHT</strong> This?</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Keto Diet</h4>
            <p>Adapting your body to use fat for fuel promotes weight loss, reduces inflammation, and improves lipid profiles, all contributing to lower sdLDL levels.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Intermittent Fasting</h4>
            <p>Cycling between periods of eating and fasting enhances insulin sensitivity, promotes fat metabolism, and can help convert sdLDL to larger, less atherogenic particles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Regular Exercise</h4>
            <p>Regular physical activity boosts HDL cholesterol, improves insulin sensitivity, and reduces inflammation, all of which contribute to lower sdLDL levels.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Relaxation</h4>
            <p>Good sleep, breaks from stress, meditation and deep breathing reduce cortisol levels and inflammation, lowering sdLDL buildup.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Omega-3</h4>
            <p>Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation, improve lipid profiles, and promote cardiovascular health, helping to lower sdLDL levels.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Soluble Fibre</h4>
            <p>Soluble fibre binds to LDL cholesterol in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption, and thereby reducing sdLDL levels.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    
    <p>Look after your overall health and you're unlikely to develop sdLDL excess and the artery and heart problems that come from that. You may wish to check your lbLDL and sdLDL levels, but remember that the results will not be conclusive evidence of problems, as many factors contribute, including HOW YOU FEEL...</p>
    
    <p>Consider healthy keto and intermittent fasting. This alone has been shown to replace high levels of sdLDL with lbLDL, unclog your arteries and save yourself from further heart problems, all without having to take statin drugs to lower this vital fatty raw material.</p>
    
    <p>That's it.</p>
