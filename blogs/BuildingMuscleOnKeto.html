        <h1>Building Muscle On Keto</h1>

        <p>Many people find the keto diet because they want to lose weight.</p>

        <p>People often stay on a keto diet because of their amazing new energy levels, in mind and body.</p>

        <h3>So What If Your Goal Is To Build Muscle?</h3>

        <p>Talk to bodybuilders and many will tell you that carbs are essential for building muscle.</p>
            
        <p>In fairness, their bodies usually suggest they know what they're talking about.</p>

        <p>But are they entirely correct? Or could the same thing be achieved with a low carb, high fat diet?</p>
            
        <p>The answers are fascinating.</p>

        <h3>Protein</h3>

        <p>Muscles are made of protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein.</p>
        
        <p>Enzymes break down protein into amino acids, which are then transported into the bloodstream and used by cells.</p>

        <p>Adequate vitamin and mineral levels are required to optimize this whole process, highlighting the need for a balanced diet and questioning the efficacy of protein shakes.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, too much protein can HINDER this process.</p>

        <h3>Insulin Resistance</h3>

        <p>Insulin is an anabolic hormone in the blood, responsible for transporting glucose into our cells.</p>
        
        <p>When we’re overloaded with dietary glucose, cells become resistant to insulin, to prevent them absorbing toxic amounts of glucose. This is insulin resistance.</p>

        <p>Additionally, insulin plays a crucial role in the absorption of amino acids into cells. Therefore insulin resistance, even when caused by glucose overload, can lessen the absorption of protein.</p>

        <p>This can lead to a vicious circle.</p>
        
        <p>When insulin resistance occurs, the pancreas responds by producing MORE insulin to manage excess blood glucose that cells are not absorbing.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, elevated insulin levels BLOCK FAT BURNING, because your body prioritizes burning the glucose in your blood first.</p>

        <p>Are you thinking you don't care much about burning fat? You’re reading this because you want to build muscle right?</p>

        <p>Well keep reading, because high insulin levels are also known to block Human Growth Hormone.</p>

        <h3>Human Growth Hormone</h3>

        <p>This hormone does exactly what it says it does. It's needed for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Muscle growth</li>
            <li>Muscle maintenance</li>
            <li>Protein optimisation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Evidence suggests the best way to elevate human growth hormone is intermittent and prolonged fasting, simply because that's the best way to combat elevated insulin.</p>

        <p>Nutritionally, a keto diet is a very effective way to keep insulin low and avoid insulin resistance.</p>

        <h3>So Do We Need Any Insulin?</h3>

        <p>Yes. Absolutely. Insulin resistance is the villian, not insulin itself.</p>
        
        <p>Anabolic processes build the body. Catabolic is the opposite process of breaking down the body.</p>

        <p>Insulin is the main anabolic hormone in the body. It plays a crucial role in anabolic processes, including muscle building, by promoting the uptake of glucose and amino acids into cells for growth and repair.</p>

        <p>Avoid insulin resistance by allowing these anabolic processes to work, before spiking it again.</p>

        <h3>So Do We Carbs For Muscle Growth?</h3>

        <p>That depends. Carbs provide quick energy and support muscle growth and recovery, but they’re not the ONLY way to do this. If you choose to consume carbs, remember that they NEED to be burned BEFORE fat.</p>

        <p>However, on a keto diet, ketone bodies are used for energy and glucose is PRESERVED in your cells, to be used when needed, with no further insulin spikes. That could help Human Growth Hormone levels.</p>

        <h3>The 3 Coponents Of All Exercise</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Time</h4>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Intensity</h4>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Recovery</h4>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Prolonged, lower intensity exercise, like long distance running, is great for endurance. However, when building muscle, consider that this type of exercise triggers more cortisol, a catabolic hormone that can break down muscle.</p>
        
        <p>For this reason, bodybuilders often choose High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) as a supplement to heavy lifting, as this triggers less cortisol and more Human Growth Hormone, helping anabolic processes during recovery times.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Remember that health is holistic. Whatever your fitness goals, find a diet that works right for you, exercise when you can and get enough recovery, ESPECIALLY sleep recovery.</p>

        <p>That's it.</p>
